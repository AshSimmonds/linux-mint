# Trials and tribulations of using Linux Mint as a primary interface to the world  
  
## What's the point?  
  
So whilst the initial onboarding experience is kinda magickal if you've ever tried other distros coming from a 99%+ Windows background, when you use it for more than casual stuff a lot of the veneer quickly wears off.  
  
Anyhoo - this isn't a bash endeavour, it's just that daily I encounter tiny things I wish I could fix, and end up down hours-long rabbit holes where the solution is 17 pages deep in a cryptic nerd war, so this is more a journey of taking LMDE to a 100% usable daily platform, from the perspective of a developer/tech heavy but perhaps not Linux super savvy entity.  
  
Will update this readme as things evolve (maybe), but generally instead of "fixing" things or posting on reddit or twitter or otherwise seeking answers straight up that lead to long battles - I'll just post an issue in this repo, then later as time allows, will seek a fix.  
  
## Help  
  
If you see an issue logged that you know the answer to, please contibute.
